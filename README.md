# Portfolio Revamp

I recently gave my portfolio a full makeover to better show who I am as a **creative developer**. It’s now more interactive, responsive, and just… me.

## What’s New

- **Next.js 14 with App Router** – cleaner routing, layouts, and metadata handling.  
- **SEO & Metadata** – all favicons, Apple icons, manifest, and robots setup so search engines know what’s up.  
- **Interactive Profile Card** – my logo, name, and socials in a sleek front/back card.  
- **Hero & Intro** – dynamic text animations and a layout that looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Tech Stack

Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React, and some animation love with ReactBits.
